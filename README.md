## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/AaryanAn/aaryan-portfolio.git
cd aaryan-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Architecture
I've built this portfolio with modularity and maintainability in mind:
- **Content**: All sections are organized in `src/index.html`
- **Styles**: Modular SCSS architecture in `src/sass/`
- **Assets**: Optimized images and documents in `src/assets/`

## Responsive Design
I've ensured the portfolio works seamlessly across all devices:
- **Desktop** (1200px+): Full feature experience with animations
- **Tablet** (768px - 1199px): Optimized layouts with touch interactions
- **Mobile** (up to 767px): Streamlined experience with fast loading

## What's Next
I'm continuously improving this portfolio. Here's what I'm working on:
- [ ] **Custom Domain**: Setting up a professional domain
- [ ] **Research Section**: Showcasing my work at UF Machine Learning Labs
- [ ] **Blog Integration**: Technical articles on systems and ML topics
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Further speed improvements
- [ ] **Advanced Animations**: Enhanced micro-interactions and transitions
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: User preference controls

## Acknowledgments

While this portfolio was initially inspired by the [Simplefolio](https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio) template created by [Jacobo Martinez](https://github.com/cobiwave), I've completely transformed it with extensive customizations:

- **Custom Dark Theme**: Complete color palette overhaul with teal gradients and modern styling
- **Enhanced Animations**: Advanced ScrollReveal animations with staggered timing
- **Technical Skills Section**: Custom badge system with categorized skills
- **Modern UX**: Improved typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- **Performance Optimizations**: Custom SCSS architecture and optimized assets
- **Responsive Design**: Enhanced mobile and tablet experiences

The result is a completely personalized portfolio that reflects my unique style and technical focus in systems engineering and machine learning.
